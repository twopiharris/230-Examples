    <h1>Assembly / Machine Language Lab</h1>
    <div class = "singlePanel">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this lab is to familiarize you with the
      lower-level operations of a computer, specifically machine and
      assembly language instructions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Introducing xMachine</h2>
    <p>
      We will use a simulated processor called 'xComputer' for experimentation.
      This computer has a few advantages over a 'real' device:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's written in Java so you can run it anywhere</li>
        <li>It's a somewhat simplified architecture ideal for teaching</li>
        <li>The language is an elegant and clear assembler variant</li>
        <li>It uses a simple 16-bit architecture</li>
        <li>It shows what's going on more clearly than a 'real' processor</li>
        <li>It provides some error checking</li>
        <li>It's safer than a real device, because it operates in a virtual machine</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      xMachine was written by David Eck.  He has provided complete documentation and 
      tutorials available here:

    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>
      Create a multiplier in xMachine language. Consider the following factors:
    </p>    
      <ul>
        <li>You'll need two inputs and an output</li>
        <li>You may need some additional data cells</li>
        <li>Think of the definition of multiplication</li>
        <li>You'll probably need a loop</li>
        <li>You can't assume the answer (eg it should work on any inputs)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Turning it in</h2>
    <p>
      Copy and paste your code to a text document. Please be sure to add your name.
      The following rubrik will be considered for grading:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quality of the code (Does it work)</li>
        <li>Code style (labels, indentation)</li>
        <li>Completeness (Does it do all it needs to do)</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Save your program as <em>name</em>ml.txt where <em>name</em> is your userID.
    </p>
