<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>
Learn through videos, lectures, and or book up to arrays
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
The objective of this lab is to create the beginnings for a python-based card game. We DO NOT expect a fully functioning card game. What we do expect is that you create a main function and various functions that will accomplish the following goals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build a single-dimension array to keep track of the location of every card</li>
  <li>DO NOT move cards around... Just use the array to keep track of where each card is</li>
  <li>All card data is really integers - Use other arrays to translate integers to suits, ranks, and player names</li>
  <li>All cards will start in the DECK</li>
  <li>Write a function that translates a card number to a card name. HINT - look at the suitName and rankName arrays</li>
  <li>Write a function to assign a card to a given player</li>
  <li>Dealing a card involves picking a card number and assigning a new location to the corresponding element of 
      cardLoc</li>
  <li>Write a function that displays the location of every card. (Early versions should show numeric values for the 
      card number and location. Later versions can include string values for prettier output.)</li>
  <li>Write a function that prints the name of every card in a given hand</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Most people make this way too complicated</li>
  <li>You don't need any arrays I didn't already give you</li>
  <li>Do not use a two-dimensional array (unless you want to for the blackbelt challenge)</li>
  <li>Computer memory does <em>not</em> work like actual cards. You are not moving things around.</li>
</li>
 
<h2>Starter Code</h2>
<p>
  Please begin by copying the following code to your editor.  
  You will not need to change my code at all, but you will need to add several new functions
  to make it work correctly.
</p>

<pre>
""" cardGame.py
    basic card game framework
    keeps track of card locations for as many hands as needed
"""
from random import *

NUMCARDS = 52
DECK = 0
PLAYER = 1
COMP = 2

cardLoc = [0] * NUMCARDS
suitName = ("hearts", "diamonds", "spades", "clubs")
rankName = ("Ace", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", 
            "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King")
playerName = ("deck", "player", "computer")

  clearDeck()

  for i in range(5):
    assignCard(PLAYER)
    assignCard(COMP)

  showDeck()
  showHand(PLAYER)
  showHand(COMP)          
</pre>

<h2>Sample output</h2>
<p>
  Your program output should look something like this.  (It's perfectly fine if things
  don't line up perfectly.  It's the general structure I'm looking for.)

<h2>Blackbelt</h2>
<p>
  Use what you have created and extend it to actually implement a working card game. War is pretty easy, as is 
  BlackJack. If you're feeling more ambitious, you might try something like "Go Fish." Poker is easy to write, but 
  the scorekeeping can be tricky.
