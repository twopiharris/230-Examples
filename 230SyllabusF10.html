        information representation in digital computers, introduction to 
        programming in a modern high-level language, ethics, introduction to

        assignments, quizzes, and programming projects. 
        Assignments will be turned in via oncourse unless 
        otherwise indicated. There will also be two exams and
        a final project.

      <h2>Attendance</h2>
      <p>
        Computer science and computer programming are challenging topics.
        We will do our best to make sure the content of every single session
        is relevant and interesting. If you miss one session, you <em>will</em>
        fall behind. The topics tend to build on each other, so missing even
        one session can cause a ripple effect that can jeapordize the entire
        semester.
      </p>       
  
      <p>
        This course has both live (traditional classroom lecture) and distributed
        (online video-based) sections.  You are enrolled in only one of these 
        sections, but they are the same course. Students in the DE section are
        welcome to attend lectures, and students in the live section are 
        encouraged to watch the videos for backup.  All students are strongly 
        encouraged to participate in the lab session once a week.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attendance in lecture sections are required for students enrolled
        in standard version of the course.  Lab attendance is the number
        one predictor of student success, especially for students in the
        DE section.
        You are welcome to get more help from the lecturer or TAs during 
        office hours or other scheduled times, but these are not an 
        adequate replacement for participating in lab and lecture.
      </p>
 
     <!--
      <p>
        This course is meant to be challenging in a 15-week semester. It's even
        more difficult when we run it at nearly triple speed, as we do in the 
        summer.Please make every effort to stay with the schedule, as things 
        will get away from you quickly.
      </p>
    -->

      <p>
        Some of you are enrolled in a "distributed education" section
        of this class.  Distributed education is different than
        "distance ed."  This is not an independant study class. We
        have regularly scheduled lab times, and I can be available to
        meet you in many different ways. Please get help when you need
        it. Most of you will need help at some time in the
        semester. That's normal and expected.  Just ask, because
        (unlike a regular lecture) I can't see your eyes to see if
        you're following me.

      <h2>Integrity Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Students are encouraged to discuss the concepts and principles 
        amongst themselves. Such discussions help in understanding the 
        material and/or different aspects of the topics taught in the class.  
        Students may also assist in debugging each others code.  It is 
        unethical to directly transfer any portion of individual work 
        products, either by printed or electronic means, between students.  
        Student cooperation should not result in identical or near identical 
        answers/code/documentation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ALL THE MATERIAL SUBMITTED FOR GRADING MUST BE YOUR OWN
        EFFORT.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>    
        If this policy is violated then the following steps
        will be taken (at the instructor's discretion):  
      </p>
      <ul>  
        <li>rejection of submitted material with an opportunity for resubmission 
            for a reduced grade</li>
        <li>reduction of points by dividing by the number of students involved 
            in an incident</li>
        <li>assignment of a grade of ZERO for all students involved in an 
            incident</li> 
        <li>assignment of a grade of F for the course</li> 
        <li>initiation of official action against all students involved in
            an incident.</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Internet use warning:</strong>
         The Computer Science department is particularly sensitive to
        dishonest leveraging of the Internet.  Presenting information
        obtained from the Internet as your own is just as severe as
        claiming another student's work as your own.  It is extremely
        important to cite works from the Internet or other resources
        when they are the basis for your own work.  Your Internet
        research should not result in work products that are in
        identical or near identical to the original.  Posting any part
        of the course including homework, exams, or projects is
        forbidden.  Submitting any part of the course to code-for-hire
        or other support web sites is forbidden.  Accessing any online
        chat, user forum, IRC, or any other interactive discussions
        during online testing is prohibited.
