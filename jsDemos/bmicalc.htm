	/*   NOTE TO STUDENTS
     *   This code is an example for a homework assignment
     *   it is written in JavaScript, which is NOT the same
     *   language you are using.  If you turn in this code,
     *
     *   A)  It will not work
     *   B)  We will know you are being dishonest
     *
     *   It's OK to use this code as a starting place,
     *   but it's definitely easier to do it the way we ask in
     *   class.
     *   
     *   I've deliberately not put the comments in here that
     *   normally go in my code. I want you to try to do that
     *   part yourself.
     *
     *   I've also not used meaningful variable names, to
     *   discourage you from using this code yourself.
     *   
     *   Please see me or a recitation leader if you're
     *   struggling...
     *

	<h1>Body Mass Index</h1>
	
	<p>
    Use the input boxes and buttons below to see an example of the bmi calculator assignment. This example will work much like the one in 
    class but it is written in a different language.
	</p>
  
	<p>
    Note that in JavaScript, we're using dialog boxes for input and
    output because this is not a command-line driven language (at
    least not in the way it's being used here.)  Your code does NOT
    need to use pop-up dialogs.  Command-line I/O is fine.
	</p>
  
	<p>
    Please try to build this algorithm on your own. I know it is
    not difficult to see actual JavaScript code, but I have written
    this example in a far more obtuse style than I normally use.
    It will be far easier to build this algorithm up and then implement
    in Python than it will be to reverse engineer my JS code.
