	/*   NOTE TO STUDENTS
     *   This code is an example for a homework assignment
     *   it is written in JavaScript, which is NOT the same
     *   language you are using.  If you turn in this code,
     *
     *   A)  It will not work
     *   B)  We will know you are being dishonest
     *
     *   It's OK to use this code as a starting place,
     *   but it's definitely easier to do it the way we ask in
     *   class.
     *   
     *   I've deliberately not put the comments in here that
     *   normally go in my code. I want you to try to do that
     *   part yourself.
     *
     *   I've also not used meaningful variable names, to
     *   discourage you from using this code yourself.
     *   
     *   Please see me or a recitation leader if you're
     *   struggling...
     *
     *
     *   -Andy

	<p>
    Press the button to see an example of the card game assignment.
    This example will work much like the one in class but it is written
    in a different language.
	</p>
  
	<p>
    Note that in JavaScript, we're using dialog boxes for input and
    output because this is not a command-line driven language (at
    least not in the way it's being used here).  Your code does NOT
    need to use pop-up dialogs.  Command-line I/O is fine.
	</p>
  
	<p>
    Please try to build this algorithm on your own. I know it is
    not difficult to see actual JavaScript code, but I have written
    this example in a far more obtuse style than I normally use.
    It will be far easier to build this algorithm up and then implement
    in Python than it will be to reverse engineer my JS code.
