<h1>Final Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
 Create a masterpiece that demonstrates your understanding of java
 programming in the modality of your choice. Illustrate that you
 understand the fundamental concepts of this discipline and can create
 an original example specific to your own interests.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
As this course covered specific technologies, they are exected as a
minimum standard for your final project.  Unless otherwise cleared
with your instructor, your project should have the following elements:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Be written in the Java programming language</li>
  <li>Incorporate some sort of advanced data structure (database, array-based, or file-based)</li>
  <li>Incorporate some sort of user interface design (command line or standalone )</li>
  <li>Solve some identified problem</li>
  <li>Work as designed without crashing</li>
  <li>Illustrate a basic knowledge of advanced programming principles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparatory Documentation</h2>
<p>
Note some documentation will be required before the project is
complete.  This is a completely normal software engineering practice,
as you must have a basic requirements analysis in place before working
on any significant project.  The following documentation will be
required one week before the final project due date:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A one-page (or more) summary of the problem to be solved.  
    <ul>
      <li>What will the project do?</li>
      <li>Who are the main users</li>
      <li>What kinds of problems will they solve with the system?</li>
      <li>What technical skills can you expect of users?</li>
      <li>Do you expect any hardware limitations? (bandwidth, old
          browsers)</li>
      <li>Will this be a GUI design? Command Line? Why did you choose this 
          modality</li>
      <li>What are your basic design decisions? (color scheme, page
          layout, CSS design.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A data plan. (if needed)
    <ul>
      <li>A description of any key data structures needed in the program</li>
      <li>A descriptions of the fields in any data table</li>
      <li>How that data will be stored (CSV, serialized objects, array)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A system overview.
    <ul>
      <li>Diagram the main states of your system.</li>
      <li>Describe the typical user's path through he system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Actual Project</h2>
<p>
The project itself must be available online at the designated time
(although it doesn't necessarily need to run online if it's a
standalone app.)  This project must consist of binary code (class or
jar files,) the actual running project and the remainder of the
documentation, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source code listing for each Java file in the project</li>
  <li>Passwords for any password-protected fields, so instructors can
      log in as administrator</li>
  <li>Any other documentation you feel is appropriate (usability
      tests, CSS stylesheets, etc)</li>
  <li>All work must be be original.  If you use external libraries,
  algorithms etc. you must dost dcument your sources.</li>
</ul>
