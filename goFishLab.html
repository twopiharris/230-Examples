<h1>Go Fish (arrays) Lab</h1> 

<div class = "block">
<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>
The objective of this lab is to create the beginnings for a java-based
 go-fish game. We DO NOT expect a fully functioning go-fish game.
 What we do expect is that you create a main function and various
 methods that will accomplish the following goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Create variables representing the POND, the PLAYER and the COMPUTER
       <br />
       (Hint: you may want to declare these as <b>final ints</b> and initialize them to 0, 1 and 2 respectivley.  You could use these values later in your 
 program to indicate if a card is located in the POND or in the hand of the PLAYER or COMPUTER)
  </li>
  <li> Place all cards in the deck into the pond (indicate that all cards are located in the pond) </li>
  <li> Get a card from the pond and place it in the user's or computer's hand (find a card in the pond and indicate that it is now in the hand of the user or the computer)
  </li> 
  <li> Show the cards that are in the deck (we want to see all 52 cards with their suit and rank) 
       <br />
       See the hint regarding getCardName() </li>
  <li> Show the cards that are in the hands of the PLAYER and COMPUTER </li>
</ul>
</div>



<div class = "block">
<h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>
   <li>You can implement this lab without the use of two-dimensional arrays</li>
   <li>It may be easier to create a getCardName() method to determine the card name from
 the position in the deck.  This function will be very familiar if you remember
 the change-maker lab </li>

</ul>
<br />
<br />

<h2>Given Code </h2>
<pre>
public class CardGame {
  public static int[] cardLoc = [insert code here]
  
  public static String[] suitName = [insert code here]
  public static String[] rankName = [insert code here]
  
  
  public static final int DECK = 0;
  public static final int PLAYER = 1;
  public static final int COMP = 2;
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    clearDeck();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++){
      getCard(PLAYER);
      getCard(COMP);
    } // end for loop
    showDeck();
  
    showHand(PLAYER);
    showHand(COMP);
  
  } // end main
} // end class def

<h2>Blackbelt</h2>

<p>
Use what you have created and extend it to actually implement a
working go-fish game.  If go fish isn't your favorite game, you can
tranfer what you have created to make several other popular card games
such as war or blackjack.
