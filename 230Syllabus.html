        information representation in digital computers, introduction to 
        programming in a modern high-level language, ethics, introduction to 
        algorithms and data structures, and their analysis and implementation

        projects. 
        Assignments will be turned in via oncourse unless

      <h2>A note about Excellence</h2>
      <p>
        This is a university-level science class in a very demanding 
        discipline.  It will be difficult (but possible) to get a good
	grade in this class.  If you work hard, turn in all your homework,
	and show some skill, you should have no problem earning As and Bs
	on all assignments.  
      </p>

      <p>
        That does not mean it is easy to earn a perfect score on any
        assignment (although it has been done on all of them.)
        Some students have expected to earn a perfect score when they
	fulfill all the requirements. That is not my policy.  If you do
	all I ask, you will get a good grade.  If you want 100%, you need
	to do something amazing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will always give you a minimum set of expectations for assignments.
	If you fulfill all of those expectations, you will likely earn a
	B+ or A- for that project.  If you do everything I ask, you will
	probably get an A, but that does NOT mean you will get 100%.  I
	reserve those last few points to reinforce brilliance.  Many
	assignments have 'black-belt challenges,' which are suggestions
	for how you might choose to excel.  Of course, there are many
	kinds of excellence. Whether and how you choose to go beyond the
	standard requirements is up to you.
      </p>

    </div>
    
    <div class = "block"
         id = "attendance">
      <h2>Attendance</h2>
      <p>
        Computer science and computer programming are challenging topics.
        We will do our best to make sure the content of every single session
        is relevant and interesting. If you miss one session, you <em>will</em>
        fall behind. The topics tend to build on each other, so missing even
        one session can cause a ripple effect that can jeapordize the entire
        semester.
      </p>       
  
      <p>
        This course has both live (traditional classroom lecture) and distributed
        (online video-based) sections.  You are enrolled in only one of these 
        sections, but they are the same course. Students in the DE section are
        welcome to attend lectures, and students in the live section are 
        encouraged to watch the videos for backup.  All students are strongly 
        encouraged to participate in the lab session once a week.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attendance in lecture sections are required for students enrolled
        in standard version of the course.  Lab attendance is the number
        one predictor of student success, especially for students in the
        DE section.
        You are welcome to get more help from the lecturer or TAs during 
        office hours or other scheduled times, but these are not an 
        adequate replacement for participating in lab and lecture.
      </p>

      <!-- 
      <p>
        This course is meant to be challenging in a 15-week semester. It's even
        more difficult when we run it at nearly triple speed, as we do in the 
        summer.Please make every effort to stay with the schedule, as things 
        will get away from you quickly.
      </p>
      -->
      <p>
        Some of you are enrolled in a "distributed education" section
        of this class.  Distributed education is different than
        "distance ed."  This is not an independant study class. We
        have regularly scheduled recitation times, and I can be available to
        meet you in many different ways. Please get help when you need
        it. Most of you will need help at some time in the
        semester. That's normal and expected.  Just ask, because
        (unlike a regular lecture) I can't see your eyes to see if
        you're following me.
      </p>
      <!--
      <p>
        This course has been taught using many different programming languages.
	In the last few years, it was taught using Java. This semester, we
	are using the Python language. Python has proven to be 
	be a much easier language for beginners to understand, and it will
	help you grasp fundamental programming concepts more easily.  However,
	some of the online materials are still focused on Java.  Please be
	patient as I translate examples, videos, and assignments to this
	new environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Java will still be taught in CSCI 24000 (along with C and C++) so you'll
	still get to learn these critical languages.

      <h2>Integrity Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Students are encouraged to discuss the concepts and principles 
        amongst themselves. Such discussions help in understanding the 
        material and/or different aspects of the topics taught in the class.  
        Students may also assist in debugging each others code.  It is 
        unethical to directly transfer any portion of individual work 
        products, either by printed or electronic means, between students.  
        Student cooperation should not result in identical or near identical 
        answers/code/documentation.

      <p>
        <strong>ALL THE MATERIAL SUBMITTED FOR GRADING MUST BE YOUR OWN
        EFFORT.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>    
        If this policy is violated then the following steps
        will be taken (at the instructor's discretion):  
      </p>
      <ul>  
        <li>rejection of submitted material with an opportunity for resubmission 
            for a reduced grade</li>
        <li>reduction of points by dividing by the number of students involved 
            in an incident</li>
        <li>assignment of a grade of ZERO for all students involved in an 
            incident</li> 
        <li>assignment of a grade of F for the course</li> 
        <li>initiation of official action against all students involved in
            an incident.</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Internet use warning:</strong>
        The Computer Science department is particularly sensitive to
        dishonest leveraging of the Internet.  Presenting information
        obtained from the Internet as your own is just as severe as
        claiming another student's work as your own.  It is extremely
        important to cite works from the Internet or other resources
        when they are the basis for your own work.  Your Internet
        research should not result in work products that are in
        identical or near identical to the original.  Modifying
        small parts of an existing program is NOT sufficient effort to make
        a program original. Posting any part
        of the course including homework, exams, or projects is
        forbidden.  Submitting any part of the course to code-for-hire
        or other support web sites is forbidden.  Accessing any online
        chat, user forum, IRC, or any other interactive discussions
        during online testing is prohibited.
