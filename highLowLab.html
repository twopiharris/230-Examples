    <h1>High Low Lab</h1>
    <div class = "singlePanel">
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        Create a program that illustrates your understanding of conditions. Create 
        a "High-Low" game which allows the user to play a game with the computer. 
        The game will require input, output, branching and loop behaviors.
      </p>
 
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        The game begins with the computer generating a random integer between 1 and 100.
        The user will guess a number, and the computer will indicate whether the guess
        is too high, too low, or correct. This will continue until the user has correctly
        guessed the computer's number.
      </p>
      <pre>
I'm thinking of a number between
1 and 100. Guess a number, and I'll tell you
if you're too high, too low, or got it right.
Good luck!
1) Please enter a number
<span class = "human">50</span>
Too low!
2) Please enter a number
<span class = "human">75</span>
Too low!
3) Please enter a number
<span class = "human">88</span>
Too high!
4) Please enter a number
<span class = "human">80</span>
Too low!
5) Please enter a number
<span class = "human">84</span>
Too high!
6) Please enter a number
<span class = "human">82</span>
Too low!
7) Please enter a number
<span class = "human">83</span>
Correct!
It took 7 turns.

      <h2>Hints</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You'll need some type of loop around the main program</li>
        <li>Generate a random number (with java.util.Random)</li>
        <li>Get input from the user</li>
        <li>You'll need several comparisons of user's guess to target value</li>
        <li>Don't forget to give feedback to the user</li>
        <li>Watch for endless loops!</li>
        <li>Don't forget to use debug mode if you get stuck</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Blackbelt Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Once you get the basic form working, see if you can write a program
      that goes the other direction.  The user generates the number, and
      the computer tries to guess it.  A sample run might look like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
Please think of a number between
one and one hundred. I'll guess
your number. You tell me if I'm 
too high, too low, or correct.
I guess: 50
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">h</span>
I guess: 25
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">l</span>
I guess: 37
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">l</span>
I guess: 43
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">h</span>
I guess: 40
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">high</span>
Sorry, I didn't understand you...
I guess: 40
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">h</span>
I guess: 39
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">h</span>
I guess: 38
too (h)igh, too (l)ow, or (c)orrect?
<span class = "human">c</span>
I got it! it took 7 turns.
