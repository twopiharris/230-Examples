<h1>Final Project</h1>

<div class =  "block">
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
 Create a masterpiece that demonstrates your understanding of python 
 programming in the modality of your choice. Illustrate that you
 understand the fundamental concepts of this discipline and can create
 an original example specific to your own interests.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
As this course covered specific technologies, they are exected as a
minimum standard for your final project.  Unless otherwise cleared
with your instructor, your project should have the following elements:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Be written in the Python programming language</li>
  <li>Incorporate some sort of advanced data structure (database, array-based, or file-based)</li>
  <li>Incorporate some sort of user interface design (standalone or command-line menu)</li>
  <li>Solve some identified problem</li>
  <li>Work as designed without crashing</li>
  <li>Illustrate a basic knowledge of programming principles</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class = "block">
<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>
It's likely you will want to use some techniques that have not yet been
taught.  For project planning purposes you can assume you'll have the
following capabilities:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A basic graphic user interface</li>
  <li>Buttons, text fields, and text areas</li>
  <li>Basic page layout</li>
  <li>The ability to detect mouse and keyboard input</li>
  <li>Basic drawing and animation skills</li>
  <li>The ability to save and load text files</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can certainly use features not on this list (scrollbars, 
collision-detection , web scraping, and SQL databases are possible) but you will have 
to do some independant research to get these topics.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "block">
<h2>Preparatory Documentation</h2>
<p>
Note some documentation will be required before the project is
complete.  This is a completely normal software engineering practice,
as you must have a basic requirements analysis in place before working
on any significant project.  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A one-page (or more) summary of the problem to be solved.  
    <ul>
      <li>What will the project do?</li>
      <li>Who are the main users</li>
      <li>What kinds of problems will they solve with the system?</li>
      <li>What technical skills can you expect of users?</li>
      <li>Will this be a GUI design? web app? command line? Why did you choose 
          this modality?</li>
      <li>What are your basic design decisions? (color scheme, page
          layout, menu.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A data plan. (if needed)
    <ul>
      <li>An ER diagram of the data structure (if appropriate)</li>
      <li>The data should be in at least third normal form</li>
      <li>SQL script may be supplied at this time</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A system overview.
    <ul>
      <li>Diagram the main states of your system.</li>
      <li>See diagrams outlined in class for examples</li> 
      <li>Describe the typical user's path through he system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class = "block">
<h2>Actual Project</h2>
<p>
The project itself must be available online at the designated time
(although it doesn't necessarily need to run online if it's a
standalone app.)  This project must consist of
the actual running project and the remainder of the
documentation, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source code listing for each Python file in the project</li>
  <li>data diagrams and user interface diagrams</li>
  <li>Passwords for any password-protected fields, so instructors can
      log in as administrator</li>
  <li>Any other documentation you feel is appropriate (usability
      tests, CSS stylesheets, etc)</li>
  <li>You will be required to present your project in class.  You will
      have 3 minutes to demonstrate the main features of your project.</li> 
  <li>All work must be be original.  If you use external libraries,
  algorithms etc. you must document your sources.</li>
</ul>
