    <h1>Knock-Knock Lab</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Create a version of the famous "Hello World" project - with a twist.
      Write a program that asks the user's name, greets the user by name, and
      tells a knock-knock joke.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this lab is to get you acquainted with programming in 
      general, and Java in particular. The program itself is not complex, 
      but there are many factors to writing it successfully:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Installing the Java Development Kit</li>
      <li>Installing an editor</li>
      <li>Writing the program</li>
      <li>Compiling the program</li>
      <li>Viewing the output</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The program</h2>
    <p>
      The actual program is quite simple. A transcript might look like this:
      (<code>human input is in blue</code>)
    </p>
    <pre>
Hi, What's your name?
<code>Andy</code>
Here's a joke, Andy:
Knock knock
<code>who's there?</code>
Luke
<code>Luke who?</code>
Luke through the keyhole and you'll find out!
    </pre>

    <p>
      A perfect version of the program will do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask the user his or her name</li>
      <li>Repeat the user'sn name in a greeting</li>
      <li>Engage in an 'interactive' knock knock joke</li>
      <li>Take input for the user's part of the joke, but you
          don't really have to do anything with the information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
       The program will require the following elements: 
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>A main method</li>
      <li>A Scanner variable for input</li>
      <li>A String variable for the user name</li>
      <li>(optional) a second string for other input</li>
      <li>A series of output statements (System.out.println)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Turning it in</h2>
    <p>
      Please name this program Knock.java. Compile the file and combine 
      Knock.java and Knock.class in a zip file called userid_knock.zip. (userid
      will be your own userid of course.)  Turn the program in via oncourse.
    </p>
